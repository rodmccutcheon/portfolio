I'm a Software Engineer, based in Melbourne, Australia (born and bred). I can't honestly tell you why I chose to study Software Engineering at university, given I'd never written a single line of code before day one of Programming Principles 1A (HTML doesn't count!). Maybe it was the long hours I spent playing Prince of Persia on my dad's Mac. Lucky for me in turned out to be a pretty awesome career choice, and I get to build "cool stuff" at the intersection of tech and smart lighting.

By day I work at OR Technologies building revolutionary lighting control technology - check us out [here](https://www.organicresponse.com/). I'm primarily responsible for building and maintaining our web portal - based on the excellent Spring Boot and Angular JS frameworks - which connects our plug and play lighting control technology with the Internet of Things. The platform provides the ability to capture, store and analyse data in the cloud, making it accessible anywhere, anytime. Combined with central control capability, connectivity creates smarter spaces and smarter buildings.

A typical day at OR Technologies might involve building out our public API in trusty old Java, integrating with Building Automation and Control networks (BACnet) with a little Python, crafting a bespoke CLI in Scala, or spinning up cloud infrastructure (AWS) with the likes of Terraform, Ansible and Docker. There's never a dull moment!

By night you can find me playing in a local basketball comp, or sampling craft beer.
